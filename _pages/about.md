PhD Student of <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>

Research Areas: AI / NLP / LLM



Hello! I am a 1st year CS PhD at Princeton University working with <a href="https://www.peterhenderson.co/">Peter Henderson</a>. Before that, I worked as a research scientist in Amazon Foundation Model (Amazon AGI) Post-Training team with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w90wOucAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Yang Liu</a> and <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/dilek">Prof. Dilek Hakkani-Tur</a> in Sunnyvale, CA. Previously, I did my Bachelors at <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a> and then did my Masters at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.

I work primarily on natural language processing, large language models and dialogue systems. I am particularly interested in AI alignment, reasoning, and agentic behavior especially in multi-agent interactions. I am also broadly interested in socially-aware NLP and AI safety. Feel free to reach out to me to chat about research ideas and I'm open to collaborations on interesting topics!

Outside of work, I am a foodie who loves to discover local hidden gems and share with my dear friends. I also enjoy a healthy lifestyle and love doing a wide range of sports, and I recently have started running and finished my first half marathon in San Francisco in 2024. Being a language lover at heart, I've been pre-trained with Chinese and fine-tuned on English, Korean, German and Japanese in school, but I might suffer from catastrophic forgetting sometimes. I've also touched upon scriptwriting for a bit, and wrote <a herf="https://www.startfilmstudio.org/first-time-filmmaker-incubator/wedding-bells">a short film</a> based on a real story during the pandemic time, which won several local film awards in Seattle, WA.
