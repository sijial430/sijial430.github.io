PhD Student of <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>

Research Areas: ML / NLP / LLM



Hello! I am a 2nd year CS PhD at Princeton University where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://karthikncode.github.io/">Prof. Karthik Narasimhan</a> at <a href="https://pli.princeton.edu/">Princeton Language and Intelligence</a>. I am fascinated by the interactive nature of language, and am actively working on topics including **AI alignment**, **reasoning** and **agentic behavior** especially in **multi-agent systems**. Previously, I worked as a research scientist in Amazon Foundation Model (Amazon AGI) Post-Training team where I contributed as a founding member to the development of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/">Nova -- the state-of-the-art text and multimodal models</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/socialbot-grand-challenge">Alexa Prize SocialBot</a> with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w90wOucAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Yang Liu</a> and <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/dilek">Prof. Dilek Hakkani-Tur</a> in Sunnyvale, CA. Before that, I received my Bachelors from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a> and my Masters from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.

Outside of work, I value health and enjoy a wide variety of sports including snowboarding, badminton, running (half marathon record 02:10:15 set at Brooklyn, Apr 2025), volleyball and rock climbing. Being a language lover at heart, I've been pre-trained with Chinese and fine-tuned on English, Korean, German and Japanese, but I might suffer from catastrophic forgetting sometimes. I am interested in entrepreneurship and arts, and have worked as a part-time scriptwriter/filmmaker at a non-profit movie studio which I co-founded in Seattle during the pandemic (check out our very first award-winning film <a href="https://www.startfilmstudio.org/production/first-time-filmmaker-archive/wedding-bells">Wedding Bells</a> where I was the writer). I am also a cat lover and own a cute beige American shorthair.
