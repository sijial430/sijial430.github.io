PhD Student of <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Computer Science</a> at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>

Research Areas: AI / NLP / LLM



Hello! I am a 1st year CS PhD at Princeton University working with <a href="https://www.peterhenderson.co/">Peter Henderson</a>. Before that, I worked as a research scientist in **Amazon Foundation Model (Amazon AGI)** Post-Training team where I contributed as a **founding member** to the development of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/nova/">Nova -- the state-of-the-art text and multimodal models</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/socialbot-grand-challenge">Alexa Prize SocialBot</a> with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w90wOucAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Yang Liu</a> and <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/dilek">Prof. Dilek Hakkani-Tur</a> in Sunnyvale, CA. Previously, I received my Bachelors from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a> and my Masters from <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.

I work primarily on natural language processing, machine learning, and large language models. I am fascinated by the interactive nature of language, and am exploring a wide range of topics including **AI alignment**, **reasoning** and **agentic behavior** especially in multi-agent cooperations. Feel free to <a href="https://calendly.com/sl2998-princeton/quick-chats">schedule a quick chat on my calendar</a> to talk about research ideas and I'm open to collaborations on interesting topics.

Outside of work, I enjoy badminton, weight-lifting, snowboarding and running (finished my first half marathon in San Francisco in 2024). Being a language lover at heart, I've been pre-trained with Chinese and fine-tuned on English, Korean, German and Japanese, but I might suffer from catastrophic forgetting sometimes. I enjoy photography and have also touched upon scriptwriting for a bit, and wrote <a href="https://www.startfilmstudio.org/first-time-filmmaker-incubator/wedding-bells">a short film</a> based on a real story during the pandemic time and won several film festival awards.
